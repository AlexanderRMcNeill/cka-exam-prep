# Certified Kubernetes Administrator Exam Preparation
This repository contains a series of tasks to help prepare people for the Certified Kubernetes Administrator Exam.

The idea behind these tasks is to practice skills related to each of the general domains listed on the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation website](https://www.cncf.io/certification/cka/). These tasks are intended to be completed using the [Kubernetes Offical Reference documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/) as this can be used during the exam. 

Each of the tasks will have two hidden sections at the bottom. One section will provide helpful links to the [Kubernetes Offical Reference documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/). The second section will contain a solution to the task (Note: There are multiple ways achieving the same task. The solutions provided are only a way of completing the task.)
